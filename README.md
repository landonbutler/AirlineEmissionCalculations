<!-- ABOUT -->
## About the Project
Enabled through an aviation emissions estimation tool that is both publicly-accessible and comprehensive, together we can help shape a more sustainable and equitable U.S. air transportation system. This calculator provide emissions estimates for every U.S. domestic flight (as provided by BTS' On-Time data) by matching each airplane's tail number to the equipped engine, which allows us to consider the particular emission factors by time in each stage of flight. Overall, this estimation tool utilizes and integrates six different public datasets provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), EUROCONTROL, and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to. Additionally, our calculator computes the emissions of four different greenhouse gases (CO2, NOx, CO, HC) during both the LTO and CCD flight cycles. This repository not only contains an easy-to-use Python script to calculate emissions for every domestic flight in a month of your choosing, but also the source Matlab code which contains more in-depth analysis tools.
